	<p class="para">A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website.<span class="a"> Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized.</span> A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears.<span class="b">  As the keystone of a web designerâ€™s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience</span>   removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.</p>
